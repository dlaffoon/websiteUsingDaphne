# websiteUsingDaphne (very simple chat application)

I created this following the instructions at Django Channels & WebSockets Oversimplified: https://youtu.be/cw8-KFVXpTE

See these source files for the bulk of the changes to make this application work:

In the Chat app:
- consumer.py
- routing.py

In base app dir:
- asig.py
- settings.py
